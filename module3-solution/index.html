      A la Veracruzana
    </div>
    <p>The inimitable and iconic tomato sauce dish of Veracruz, seasoned with ingredients like capers, garlic, pickled jalapenos, olives. It's typically but not exclusively served over red snapper, marinated in lime and cooked in the sauce. 
    a la Veracruzana (Veracruz-Style Red Snapper) is a classic fish dish from Veracruz, Mexico. <br>It has been called the signature dish of the state of Veracruz. It combines ingredients and cooking methods from Spain and from pre-colonial Mexico. The use of olives and capers give something of a Mediterranean flavor to the dish, and shows the Spanish influence. <br>Traditionally, a whole red snapper is used, gutted and de-scaled and marinated in lime juice, salt, pepper, nutmeg and garlic. A sauce is made of onions, garlic, tomato, jalapenos, olives and herbs, and the fish is baked with the sauce until tender. Capers and raisins may also be used. If red snapper is not available, another type of rockfish may be substituted. The dish is traditionally served with small roasted potatoes and Mexican-style white rice</p>

      Mole Poblano
    </div>
    <p>The national dish of Mexico contains about 20 ingredients, including chili peppers and chocolate, which works to counteract the heat of the chili peppers, but the chocolate does not dominate. It helps give the sauce its dark color, but this is also provided by the mulato peppers. Served with bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts or leg.<br>The state of Oaxaca is large and very mountainous with various indigenous ethnicities and microclimates, making for a number of regional variations in the food. The state is called "the land of the seven moles", with these being named mole negro, colorado, amarillo, verde, chichilo, coloradito, and mancha manteles (or tablecloth stainer), all differently colored and flavored, based on the use of distinctive chilis and herbs. The last, mancha manteles, is a chicken and fruit stew, and although Oaxaca claims it as the seventh mole, some, such as Susan Trilling in her book My Search for the Seventh Mole: A Story with Recipes from Oaxaca, Mexico, question whether it is a true mole. In addition, those from Puebla claim this dish as their own.<br>The best known of Oaxaca's moles is mole negro, which is darker than mole poblano and just as thick and rich. It also includes chocolate, as well as chili peppers, onions, garlic and more, but what makes it distinct is the addition of a plant called hoja santa. It is the most complex and difficult to make of the sauces. Mole coloradito is another popular preparation, often simplified and sold as an enchilada sauce. Mole verde is always made fresh with herbs native to the region.</p>

      Tlayudas
    </div>
    <p>Pronounced tla-u-da, with an emphasis on the “u”, tlayudas are an iconic Oaxacan street snack. Sometimes referred to as “Mexican pizza” but more of a flatbread, a tlayuda starts with a very large, thin, crispy corn tortilla that is baked on a comal or wood grill.  The tortilla is covered with refried or pureed beans and other toppings.  Served with shredded lettuce or cabbage, avocado, strips of meat (tasajo or cecina are most common), quesillo (Oaxacan string cheese) and salsa.<br>The dinner plate-sized tortilla is either seared (usually on a comal) or charred on a grill. Refried beans are then applied, along with lard and vegetables, to serve as a base for the main ingredients. The rules for topping a tlayuda are not strict, and restaurants and street vendors often offer a variety of toppings, including "'tasajo" (cuts of meat typical of Central Valley of Oaxaca), chorizo, and cecina enchilada (thin strips of chili powder-encrusted pork). They may be prepared open-faced or folded in half.</p>
