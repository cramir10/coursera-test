                <p>The inimitable and iconic tomato sauce dish of Veracruz, seasoned with ingredients like capers, garlic, pickled jalapenos, olives. It's typically but not exclusively served over red snapper, marinated in lime and cooked in the sauce.</p>

                <div id="item2">Mole Poblano con Pollo</div>
                <p>The national dish of Mexico contains about 20 ingredients, including chili peppers and chocolate, which works to counteract the heat of the chili peppers, but the chocolate does not dominate. It helps give the sauce its dark color, but this is also provided by the mulato peppers. Served with bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts or leg.</p>

                <div id="item3">Tlayudas</div>
                <p>Pronounced tla-u-da, with an emphasis on the “u”, tlayudas are an iconic Oaxacan street snack. Sometimes referred to as “Mexican pizza” but more of a flatbread, a tlayuda starts with a very large, thin, crispy corn tortilla that is baked on a comal or wood grill.  The tortilla is covered with refried or pureed beans and other toppings.  Served with shredded lettuce or cabbage, avocado, strips of meat (tasajo or cecina are most common), quesillo (Oaxacan string cheese) and salsa.</p>
